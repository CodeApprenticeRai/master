This app allows for instructors to create and serve multiple choice questions to students.

Quickstart Guide:
1. Install a python virtual enviornment using 'python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv'
2. Create a new venv using 'python3 -m venv env'
3. Enter the venv using 'source env/bin/activate'
4. install django using 'python -m pip install Django'
5. Cd into master/master and use the command 'python3 manage.py runserver' to begin the server.
6. In a web browser go to 'localhost:8000'
7. For ease's sake, a user already exists with the username 'test_user' and password 'working_at_the_car_wash'. Creating a new user can also be done from the sign up page.
8. The remaining flow of use is simple. The creation of users, challenges, and questions are all aptly labeled. So too are the taking of challenges and analytics. The encapsulation of objects is the challenges contain questions, and questions do not exist on their outside the context of a challenge.
9. Challenge invititions are also easily found.
